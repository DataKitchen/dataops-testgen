    \ day within the minimum and maximum date range for the column. The test is relevant\
    \ for transactional data, where you would expect at least one transaction to be\
    \ recorded each day. A failure here would suggest missing records for the number\
    \ of days identified without data. You can adjust the threshold to accept a number\
    \ of days that you know legitimately have no records. "
