    This test measures the similarity of two sets of counts per categories, by using their proportional counts as probability distributions.  Using Jensen-Shannon divergence, a measure of relative entropy or difference between two distributions, the test assigns a score ranging from 0, meaning that the distributions are identical, to 1, meaning that the distributions are completely unrelated. This test can be used to compare datasets that may not match exactly, but should have similar distributions.  For example, it is a useful sanity check for data from different sources that you would expect to have a consistent spread, such as shipment of building materials per state and construction projects by state. Scores can be compared over time even if the distributions are not identical -- a dataset can be expected to maintain a comparable divergence score with a reference dataset over time. Both tables must be present to run this test.
